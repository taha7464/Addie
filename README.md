Addie is a chatbot that utilizes Artifical Intelligence to help students study in a more fun, casual, and intuitive way. She texts students about relevant coursework randomly thorughout the day, quizzing them on topics they need to cover. 

Powered by IBM Watson, Addie communicates using natural language and texts the end user. Texting is done through Twilio.

Running server.js allows Addie to reply to a message that passes through the Watson framework.

NOTE: 
Currently we have hard coded a response, which users will recieve when they SMS/text Addie. 
In the future we will integrate Watson, Node-Red and Twilio to provide the user a relevant response.
