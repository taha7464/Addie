Addie is a chatbot that utilizes Artifical Intelligence to help students study in a more fun, casual, and intuitive way. She texts students about relevant coursework randomly thorughout the day, quizzing them on topics they need to cover. When quizzing students, Addie rewards students when they answer correctly, helping them rack up points and win acheivements. She also tutors her students by guiding them to correct answers when they submit an incorrect response. Addie's goal is to remove the need to cram in study sessions and promote a more continous studying model.

Powered by IBM Watson, Addie communicates using natural language and texts the end user. Texting is done through Twilio.

Running server.js allows Addie to reply to a message that passes through the Watson framework.

Beyond her texting capabilities, Addie also tracks a students performance and progress within her courseload. Through the Addie app, students can measure their proficiency in a course and create goals through Study Plans. They can also review audio files, textbooks, and other class recources on the fly--making their studying experience even more mobile. Addie even allows students to schedule upcoming exams and control how often they want to be texted by her about the subjects that they need to cover. Paired with the Addie app, studying becomes more convienent.

NOTE: 
Currently we have hard coded a response, which users will recieve when they SMS/text Addie. 
In the future we will integrate Watson, Node-Red and Twilio to provide the user a relevant response.
